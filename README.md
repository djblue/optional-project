# Principles of Model Checking and Program Verification 

This project implements a DFA simulator to do model checking...

## Required Virtual Machine

To run this project, you need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed; a
lightweight javascript vm based on Google's V8 engine..

## 1. Introduction 

- What is model checking? 
- Where is it used? I.e., provide an application domain 

## 2. Finite Automata 

- What is the formal definition of an automaton? 
- What data structure did you use to represent the automaton? 

## 3. Operations on Automata 

- What is the algorithm that you used to compute the complement and
  intersection? 
- What is the computational complexity of the algorithms? 

## 4. Searching for counterexamples 

- How do you search an automaton for a string? 
- What is the computational complexity of the search algorithm? 

## 5. What were the lessons learnt when applying your tool to the infusion pump example? 

## 6. Conclusions 

## 7. References
